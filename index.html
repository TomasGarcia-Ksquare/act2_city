                <p>Mérida is the capital of the Mexican state of Yucatán, and the largest city in southeastern Mexico.
                    The city is also the seat of the eponymous Municipality. It is located in the northwest corner of
                    the Yucatán Peninsula, about 35 km inland from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
                <p>The city's rich cultural heritage is a product of the syncretism of the Maya and Spanish cultures
                    during
                    the colonial era. It was the first city to be ever named American Capital of Culture and is the only
                    city that has received the title twice. The Cathedral of Mérida, Yucatán was built in the late 16th
                    century with stones from nearby Mayan ruins and is known to be the oldest cathedral in the mainland
                    Americas. In addition, the city has the third largest old town district on the continent. In
                    2007, the city was visited by former U.S. President George W. Bush to meet with the ex-president of
                    Mexico Felipe Calderón for the historic creation of the Mérida Initiative.</p>
                <p>Mérida is often considered the safest city of Mexico and one of the safest cities in the Americas. In
                    2019 it hosted the 17th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, receiving more than 30 of them. It is
                    a City of Gastronomy as part of the UNESCO's Creative Cities Network. The UN-Habitat's City
                    Prosperity Index recognized Mérida as the best city to live in Mexico for its high quality of life.
                    The city was certified as an International Safe Community by the Karolinska Institute of Sweden for
                    its
                    high level of public security. Forbes magazine has ranked Mérida three different times as one of the
                    three best cities in Mexico to live, invest and do business.</p>

                    alt="Cochinita Pibil">

                <p>This dish is the best known in the Yucatán Peninsula and is my favourite in the culinary crown of
                    Mérida
                    food.
                    It is cooked using a technique created by Maya people called “pib”, which means “buried”. Therefore,
                    these are holes in the ground that function as furnaces. </p>
                <p>The “Cochinita Pibil” is a preparation of pork marinated with delicious spices. You can eat it with
                    diferent presentations like: </p>
                <ul>

                <p>Mérida is a grate place to embark on a fun day trip to exploring the places that offers. Here i leave
                    you
                    the best thing to see and do in Mérida:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Plaza Grande</li>
                    <p>Plaza Grande is both the commercial and cultural hub of Mérida, and is a good place to start a
                        walking tour of the old city center. In
                        addition to being surrounded by some of Mérida's most important buildings, it's also a very
                        pleasant
                        space to simply hang out, thanks to its shady palm trees, beautiful flower gardens, and
                        fountains.
